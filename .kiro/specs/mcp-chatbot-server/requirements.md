# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides a chatbot with weather information and real-time Google search capabilities. The server will integrate with Gemini 2.5 Flash API for conversational AI and OpenWeatherMap API for weather data, while implementing Google search without requiring API keys. The system is designed for the Puch.ai hackathon Phase 1 requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an MCP client, I want to interact with a chatbot server, so that I can have conversational interactions through the MCP protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the MCP server THEN the server SHALL establish a valid MCP connection
2. WHEN a client sends a chat message THEN the server SHALL process the message using Gemini 2.5 Flash API
3. WHEN the Gemini API responds THEN the server SHALL return the response through the MCP protocol
4. IF the Gemini API is unavailable THEN the server SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the chatbot, I want to get current weather information for any location, so that I can make informed decisions about my activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for weather information with a location THEN the system SHALL query the OpenWeatherMap API
2. WHEN weather data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL format and return current conditions, temperature, humidity, and description
3. IF an invalid location is provided THEN the system SHALL return a helpful error message
4. WHEN weather data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the chatbot, I want to perform real-time Google searches without API keys, so that I can get current information on any topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a search query THEN the system SHALL perform a web search without requiring Google API keys
2. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL return relevant results with titles, snippets, and URLs
3. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately
4. IF the search service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be extensible for future features, so that I can easily add new capabilities without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL support them through a modular architecture
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL register all available tools and capabilities with the MCP client
3. WHEN a tool is called THEN the system SHALL route the request to the appropriate handler
4. IF a tool fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the server

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want the MCP server to be easily deployable and configurable, so that judges and users can quickly set it up and test it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is started THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about required configuration
3. WHEN the server starts successfully THEN it SHALL log its status and available capabilities
4. IF the server encounters startup errors THEN it SHALL provide helpful debugging information
