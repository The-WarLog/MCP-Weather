# Puch.AI MCP Chatbot Server - Hackathon Demo Script

## üéØ **Demo Overview**
This MCP server provides 3 powerful AI tools through the Model Context Protocol:
- **AI Chat** with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Real-time Weather** data
- **Web Search** without API keys

## üöÄ **Live Demo Steps**

### **Step 1: Show Server Status**
```bash
python main.py --config
```
*"Here's our production-ready MCP server with proper configuration management"*

### **Step 2: Test Individual Tools**

**AI Chat:**
```bash
python main.py --chat "Explain what MCP is and why it's revolutionary for AI assistants"
```

**Weather Data:**
```bash
python main.py --weather "San Francisco"
```

**Web Search:**
```bash
python main.py --search "latest AI news 2025"
```

### **Step 3: Show MCP Server Running**
```bash
python main.py --server
```
*"Now the server is running and ready to accept MCP connections"*

### **Step 4: Demonstrate in MCP Client**

In your MCP client (like Kiro IDE), show:

1. **Multi-tool Query:**
   - "What's the weather in Tokyo and search for recent AI developments there?"

2. **Conversational AI:**
   - "Tell me about Python programming and then search for the latest Python news"
